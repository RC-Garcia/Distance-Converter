# Distance-Converter
In this code, the convert_distance function takes three arguments: the distance to be converted, the unit of the distance to convert from, and the unit to convert to. It uses a dictionary conversion_rates to store the conversion factors between different units.  You can call the convert_distance function with the desired distance.
